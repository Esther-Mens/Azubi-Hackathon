Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo whose popularity has risen the most during this period of global health crisis for the exemplary leadership he had shown in fighting the pandemic.If Covid-19 could not stop these countries from organizing public elections, then it certainly should not be able to stop the NPP and Ghana from undertaking similar exercise.It is instructive to remind ourselves that other countries in Africa and elsewhere including Guinea, Mali, Cameroon, Burundi, Benin, South Korea among others have all been able to successfully hold general elections this year.The Party wishes to use this opportunity to appeal to all stakeholders particularly the party’s rank and file to once again strictly adhere to the rules of engagement spelt out by NEC including the Coviid-19 health protocols for the conduct of the exercise.Let it be said once again that the NPP went into these primaries and came out as a much stronger party poised to winning the 2020 general elections in order to continue to deliver prosperity to the Ghanaian people. It is indeed doable, and the NPP shall do it again.I wish all our aspirants the very best of luck, and I urge all who are involved in the process to help ensure that the elections are held in a free, fair and peaceful manner.pic.twitter.com/25Nu6z5caApic.twitter.com/E6ymsmFge6I wish the former President of the Republic, H.E Flt.

May Allah preserve him and grant him good health to continue to help in nation-building.pic.twitter.com/5nQksuXgtpAs we develop a greater appreciation and affection for words that heal, bless and cheer, we will certainly develop an even greater disdain for words that discourage, disparage and destroy.The @NPP_GH is grateful to the almighty God, all delegates in the just ended extraordinary constituency delegates conference of the party, the aspiring parliamentary candidates and indeed all the members of the party for a successful parliamentary primaries over the weekend.The primaries, which were held simultaneously in the 168 constituencies across the country on Saturday were extremely peaceful and successful except in a few isolated cases where some not very palatable scenes were recorded in some 3 or 4 constituencies out of the 168.Of course, the NPP did not and could not have anticipated a hundred percent (100%) incidence-free primaries because perfection and infallibility exist nowhere in human lexicon.The successful conduct of the primaries, which is the first democratic exercise involving mass participation that the country has experienced since the outbreak of Covid-19, fortifies our conviction that the country can equally undertake the other democratic exercises ahead of usHaving said that, the party wishes to, on this occasion, congratulate all the newly elected Parliamentary Candidates and urges them to reach out to their opposing candidates in the primaries and their supporters with the view to achieving unity and cohesion at the constituency.To the aspiring candidates who were unsuccessful in the contest including the incumbent MPs who were not given the nod by the delegates in order to have yet another opportunity to renew their mandate in the 2020 general elections ... 1/2The party commends them for putting up a healthy contest and wishes them a better luck next time. They should all take consolation in the fact that the process had been very successful contrary to the wishes of our detractors. 2/2Indeed, it is our position that there had not been winners and there had not been losers in the Saturday primaries. The biggest beneficiary and for that matter the real winner is the NPP.We must all take pride in the fact that the rules of engagements spelt out by the party have largely been complied with thereby culminating in this historic milestone, which has further vindicated the NPP’s unbeatable democratic credentials.... and therefore commends its members/delegates, officials of the electoral commission, the media as well as the security agencies and indeed all persons who played various roles towards the attainment of this enviable feat. 2/2The party also notes with delight that there had been a significant compliance with the Covid-19 health protocols that were put in place at each polling centre ...1/2pic.twitter.com/LSbHexcpzKThis morning, I participated in a virtual session of the United Kingdom-Ghana Business Council meeting which comprises officials of the UK and Ghana government.

We, in Ghana, believe that an increase in trade is the surest way to deepen regional integration in Africa. #AfCFTAinGhanaThe pandemic has heightened the importance of the success of the #AfCFTA.The disruption of global supply chains has reinforced the necessity for closer integration amongst us, so that we can boost our mutual self-sufficiency, strengthen our economies, and reduce our dependence on external sources. #AfCFTAinGhanaWe are now the world’s largest free trade area since the formation of the World Trade Organisation, and we must make it count. #AfCFTAinGhanaCovering a market of 1.2bn people, with a combined GDP of $3 trillion, across the 54 Member States of the AU that have signed up to the Agreement, … 1/2… it will provide the vehicle for us to trade among ourselves in a more modern and sophisticated manner; it will offer a huge opportunity to exploit the abundant wealth and resources of our great continent for the benefit of all our people. 2/2“Apart from roads, Government is very busily implementing other major pieces of infrastructure across the country in the education sector, health, water and sanitation, aviation, railways, ports and harbours and so on.” @MBawumia #NPPInfrastructureRecord“It is normally said that every government builds infrastructure. That is quite true. But it is not every government that has the vision and the ability to implement groundbreaking policies that will transform and modernize the nation.” @MBawumia #NPPInfrastructureRecord“We are not just building roads and infrastructure; we are building a country. We are building an inclusive, modern economy while at the same time reducing the suffering of our people.” @MBawumia #NPPInfrastructureRecordEven though the data shows that there is no 1st term gov't in the history of the 4th Rep. that has built more infrastructure than the gov't of @NAkufoAddo, we know that building infrastructure is not enough; we need to build a nation. #NPPInfrastructureRecord“The record that we have established between 2017 and 2019 is very very clear. We have restored macroeconomic stability, we are putting this country on the road to self-sufficiency in agriculture and we are industrializing this country.” @MBawumia #NPPInfrastructureRecordThe soft components of Ghana’s infrastructure base have witnessed improving performance over the past three years, thereby helping the country to maintain satisfactory growth. #NPPInfrastructureRecordThe country’s rising trade has been reflected in growing cargo throughput, which increased from 15.99 million (2014) to about 23.13 million (2018). #NPPInfrastructureRecordFrom 17.71 million in 2010, the mobile telephony subscriber base expanded to 40.9 million by December 2018. Data and mobile penetration rates stand at 88.84% and 138.8% respectively (December, 2018). #NPPInfrastructureRecordThe govt of @NAkufoAddo has been in office for a little over 3 years. Even though there is still a lot to do, any objective assessment of our performance will agree that we have performed much better than the situation that we inherited in 2017. @MBawumia #NPPInfrastructureRecordAll the major indicators - Agriculture, Industry, Inflation, Interest rates, job creation, education, provision of essential services, resourcing the security and anti-corruption agencies, justice delivery, etc, show we have performed better. @MBawumia #NPPInfrastructureRecord“We have done all of these, while providing infrastructure in schools all across the country to ensure the success of Free SHS, while building health infrastructure and constructing roads.” @MBawumia #NPPInfrastructureRecord“Contractors are getting paid, every sector of the economy is witnessing major infrastructure development. All of these works are going on even now despite the global challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic.” @MBawumia #NPPInfrastructureRecordThe true test of the robustness of an economy can be measured in a time of crisis: Dumsor (internal) and COVID (external). No mitigating measures under Mahama for businesses and individuals? They rather increased electricity and fuel prices.” #NPPInfrastructureRecord“We have been able to do all this because we have built a strong economy and managing it in a way that allows us to continue to do these and more even amidst a global pandemic.” @MBawumia #NPPInfrastructureRecord“The data is clear. My humble advice to the former President Mahama is to take a look at the data (not Green Book data) and try to understand it before you speak otherwise you will embarrass yourself.” @MBawumia #NPPInfrastructureRecordOver the past two years, the Akufo-Addo administration has built more classroom buildings, dormitories and other amenities than the regime preceding this administration. #NPPInfrastructureRecordIt is safe to conclude that a lot more infrastructural projects have been undertaken by this government in three years than even the E-Blocks the NDC constructed in eight years. #NPPInfrastructureRecord12 hours to #NPPInfrastructureRecord #BawumiaSpeakspic.twitter.com/zuJHnjaKJj#BawumiaSpeaks #NPPInfrastructureRecordpic.twitter.com/nhPvNwdliTJohn Mahama presided over a decline in economic growth for his four years in office while Nana Akufo-Addo has presided over higher economic growth in his first three years in office before the COVID-19 pandemic. #MahamaDidNothingJohn Mahama presided over a decline in agriculture.

This session will be moderated by @kaessuman and we will be using the hashtags: #NPPChats and #NPPManifestoLaunch.@kaessuman: A1. Manifestos are necessary because they outline the ideas, vision, policies and programmes of a political party, based on which the electorate should vote for that political party. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A1. We in the @NPP_GH consider our manifesto to be a social contract between an NPP Government and Ghanaians pursuant to which we fulfill our promises when elected to serve the people of #Ghana. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A1. We believe that manifestos have an impact in elections in Ghana. As you already, the people of Ghana voted for us overwhelmingly based on the promises we made in our 2016 manifesto and we have fulfilled them. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A2. Yes, the @NPP_GH Government under the leadership of @NAkufoAddo has fulfilled the promises contained in the 2016 manifesto. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A2. We promised #FreeSHS and we have delivered. We promised One District One Factory and we have delivered. We promised Planting For Food and Jobs and we have delivered. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A2. We promised building a strong economy for the people of Ghana and we have delivered. We promised jobs for the youth of Ghana and we have delivered through #NABCO. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A3. The Manifesto Launch is happening in Cape Coast. However, because of the COVID19 restrictions, attendance is by invitation only. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A3. We encourage all party members, well wishers and all Ghanaians to watch the launch live on television or social media or listen to their radios in the comfort of their homes. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A3. The event commences at 10am. The programme for the event has been prepared for all Ghanaians and will showcase the work that the @NPP_GH Government has done in its first term in office. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A4. Ghanaians can expect more policies and programmes that will transform their lives. The @NPP_GH has demonstrated that it is a party of its word. We deliver on our promises to the Ghanaian people. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A4. Ghanaians should also expect policies and programmes that will protect their lives and livelihoods during and after the COVID19 pandemic. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A4. Ghanaians can expect policies and programmes that will build a strong economy for all Ghanaians. We have done it before and we can do it again. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A5. We believe that everyone should have an opportunity to read our manifesto the best way they can. We intend to make our manifesto available to all Ghanaians from all walks of life. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A5. When Ghanaians have the opportunity to read our policies and programmes, they will #TrustAkufoAddo and vote for him again in December 2020. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A5. We intend to engage young people on social media on the various policies and programmes in our manifesto and ensure that they understand the decision they are making about their future. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A6. We want people to remember that the @NPP_GH Government has performed better and has served the people of Ghana; and that the @NPP_GH has fulfilled its promises and will continue to put the people of Ghana first. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A6. We want people to remember that @NAkufoAddo is a President who thinks and cares about the safety and livelihood of all Ghanaians; and that he believes every Ghanaian deserves an opportunity. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunch@kaessuman: A6. We want people to remember that the @NPP_GH Government has done a lot of work for the people of Ghana and has served Ghanaians diligently. We want people to remember that the NPP is the only party that can make their lives better. #NPPChats #NPPManifestoLaunchThank you to our moderator, @kaessuman, and to everyone for join us on this evening’s #NPPChats.

The survey revealed profound challenges. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestNotable among them were the large infrastructure deficit, their constraint on our development, their uneven distribution across the country, and the wide disparity in urban and rural development. @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestIn line with the government’s agenda to ensure inclusive and accelerated economic development, our focus has been to provide infrastructure for all. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestOur approach to the infrastructure development of Ghana has been twofold: ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestFirst, to provide for the infrastructure needs of the poor and deprived communities at the micro level (like water, toilets, clinics and electricity) which many governments have historically ignored. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestSecond, to provide for the broader infrastructure needs of the economy at the macro-level to drive economic growth. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestInfrastructure for all includes all the amenities that people need in order to unleash the potentials for growth in their communities, constituencies, and districts, and ultimately improve the conditions of everyday living. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestInfrastructure for all also includes facilities and systems to support industrial and other economic activities. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestGiven that we are in the age of the 4th industrial revolution, it is inevitable that we get on the transitioning of the Ghanaian economy from low to high productivity level driven by digitization. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestTo enable us do this we have to put in place the required soft infrastructure: the digital infrastructure which in many respects may be more important than the physical infrastructure that we are used to. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestTo enable all Ghanaians, researchers, CSOs, have access to and interrogate the data we have put all this data together on a website: http://www.deliverytracker.gov.gh . ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestAs the name implies, “delivery tracker” is a portal where you can track the status of delivery of government promises and also infrastructure projects. It will enhance transparency and accountability in our governance. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestGhana is the only country in Africa that has implemented this publicly accessible delivery tracker for its infrastructure projects. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestI will focus on roads, agriculture, industry, sports, housing, airport, sea defence, fish landing sites, markets, security and digital infrastructure. These projects have been captured in the delivery tracker website.~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonest#BawumiaIsHonestpic.twitter.com/NuyOdsx6irIn total, about 17,334 individual projects have been started since January 2017. We have completed a total number of 8,746 projects throughout the country. A further 8588 projects are at different stages of completion throughout he country. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestThis is consistent with our strategic orientation to ensure the development of broad base, wide scale infrastructure, taking place in every district across the country instead of a few big infrastructure projects in a few cities. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestImprovement of road infrastructure has been a major priority for this government. On assumption of office we were met with protests across the country about the poor state of the road network. ~ @MBawumia #BawumiaIsHonestWe have implemented several initiatives to improve the road network of the country to enhance economic activities of citizens and to improve access and living conditions of our people.

He simply does not care about the next generation. #MahamaWillCancelFreeSHSMahama said it is expensive to spend 2 billion cedis on Free SHS alone. #MahamaWillCancelFreeSHSJohn Mahama cancelled the Arabic Teachers Allowance. John Mahama cancelled the Teacher trainee allowance (alawa) John Mahama will cancel Free SHS #MahamaWillCancelFreeSHSMahama believes It is unwise to implement Free SHS Policy he made this point at the NDC’s Tarkwa unity walk. It is this belief that will guide him to cancel the Free SHS policy. #MahamaWillCancelFreeSHSMahama and the NDC are complaining about Free SHS because they claim their problem is Nana Addo is using Oil revenue to finance. They just want to use the money to pay judgement debt instead of using it for free SHS. #MahamaWillCancelFreeSHSSo Mahama wants to cancel free SHS and tell the kids to go and ride Okada. #MahamaWillCancelFreeSHSMahama had Access to the financial dealings of the country as President and concluded that Free SHS is not possible. The guy has not changed he is just angry that Nana has proven him wrong, he just want to come prove why it won’t work. #MahamaWillCancelFreeSHSMahama wants Free SHS to fail so that he can say the proverbial “I told you so” to Ghanaians about it being impossible. #MahamaWillCancelFreeSHSMahama would rather give Ghana’s bauxite to his brother than to invest it in Free Senior High.

sector mess we inherited, and have, with the active co-operation of the Bank of Ghana, strengthened the banking and financial sector. #FinancialSectorCleanUpToday, we are going to tell you all about the #FinancialSectorCleanUp. It is important that every Ghanaian knows what has gone on in the financial services sector especially because John Mahama caused a mess and risked the entire financial stability of #Ghana.The NPP inherited a weak and fragile financial services sector from the Mahama-led NDC Government. #FinancialSectorCleanUpMany financial institutions had either collapsed or were on the verge of collapse. Many were not paying their depositors or employees at all or regularly. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThere were countless instances where customers made long journeys to withdraw as little as GH¢200 only to be asked to come another day. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThese failures were a direct result of a system of poor licensing and regulation, non-existent capital, weak corporate governance characterised by related-party transactions, and political influence-peddling among others. #FinancialSectorCleanUpMany innocent people – depositors, investors and employees – suffered the consequences of these grievous lapses. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe Mahama-led NDC Government and the management it put in place at the Bank of Ghana, as well as at the Securities and Exchange Commission, had enough time to address these failures, but failed to take action. #FinancialSectorCleanUpBank of Ghana was, for example, aware of the impending failures in 2015, in the case of banks, and as far back as 2012, in the case of savings and loans and micro finance companies. #FinancialSectorCleanUpIn order to clean up and strengthen the sector and prevent its collapse, the new management of Bank of Ghana, which we installed, revoked the licenses of 9 banks, 23 savings and loans and 386 microfinance companies. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe central bank did this to protect the entire financial system, and preserve the hard-earned savings of hardworking men and women across the country. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe Securities and Exchange Commission also revoked the licences of 53 fund managers for the same reasons. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe clean-up exercise & the Govt’s decision to step into provide financial support, ensured an orderly exit of the failed institutions so that over 4.6 M depositors have access to their deposits & 81,700 investors to their investments & over 10K jobs saved #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe financial support, provided by the Akufo-Addo Government, ensured no depositor would lose a pesewa of their savings. #FinancialSectorCleanUp#97DaysToVote #4MoreToDoMoreForYoupic.twitter.com/9DMp1m09U5#97DaysToVote #4MoreToDoMoreForYoupic.twitter.com/ajZsLAsGgl#97DaysToVote #4MoreToDoMoreForYoupic.twitter.com/lLHjBlOZsL"We have cleaned the financial sector mess we inherited, and have, with the active co-operation of the Bank of Ghana, strengthened the banking and financial sector." ~ President Akufo-Addo #FinancialSectorCleanUpAll depositors of the banks, savings and loans, and microfinance institutions, by the end of September this year, would have received a full, 100% refund of their deposits. #FinancialSectorCleanUpEmployees, whose salaries and benefits had remained unpaid by the defunct institutions, have now been paid or are being paid by the Receivers. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe alternative would have been millions of depositors losing their savings and over 10,000 individuals losing their jobs. #FinancialSectorCleanUpBy the end of Q1 of 2020, a total of GH¢13.6bn has been spent on the resolution of failed banks, SDIs, MFIs, the establishment of the Consolidated Bank Ghana Limited (CBG), as well as the capitalisation of the Ghana Amalgamated Trust (GAT). #FinancialSectorCleanUpWith the President’s directives to pay fully all depositors whose funds were locked up with the failed SDIs and MFIs, an amount of GH¢5 billion was spent. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe total expenditure on financial sector interventions as at June 2020 to GH¢18.6bn. Govt has also committed an amount of GH¢3.1bn towards supporting investors in failed asset management companies regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe overall total Government expenditure for the failed financial institutions is GH¢21.60 billion. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe nine indigenous banks, that were closed, were to a large extent taken over by other indigenous Ghanaian banks – GCB and CBG – ensuring stronger Ghanaian ownership in the banking sector. #FinancialSectorCleanUpGAT, with 100% Government of Ghana ownership, has also successfully invested in 4 indigenous banks to help them meet the new capital requirements. #FinancialSectorCleanUpWith GAT, Government saved over 5,400 direct and 12,000 indirect jobs, and ensured that the country retained nine indigenous banks instead of only four, after the increase in the minimum capital requirement for the banking industry. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe transformational plan, being executed by GAT and the investee banks, will have a significant positive impact on these banks and the economy as a whole. #FinancialSectorCleanUpThe benefits of the clean-up exercise, including other regulatory reforms such as Bank of Ghana’s Corporate Governance Directive (December, 2018) and Fit and Proper Persons Directive (July 2019), are evident for all to see. #FinancialSectorCleanUpWe now have a stronger and more resilient banking sector than we have ever had, and deposits in the banking system have increased significantly as customers’ confidence in the system has rebounded. #FinancialSectorCleanUp"By the end of 2019, all the financial sector soundness indicators showed strong improvements as capital adequacy ratio, profitability, and liquidity levels increased significantly while non-performing loans declined.” ~ Dr. Ernest Addison (Governor, BoG) #FinancialSectorCleanUp#FinancialSectorCleanUppic.twitter.com/cPzDgYPBttdays to vote. #4MoreToDoMoreForYoupic.twitter.com/cfVGond5Irpic.twitter.com/bgQGfpzdoV#LeadershipOfService #4MoreForNanapic.twitter.com/2RI3GSPMP7The issues of housing and cost of rent, as well as, regulations governing them are of utmost significance to our daily lives.
