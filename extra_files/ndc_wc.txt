We of the NDC @OfficialNDCGh do not wish this for our dear country, hence our constant warnings.NIA was set up with mandate to issue national ID cards and manage National Identification System (NIS) as per National Identification Authority Act, 2006 (Act 707). Subsequently National Identity Register Act, 2008 (Act 750) was passed to govern functions and operations of NIA.Upon extensive consultations with all stakeholders including Political Parties, the following registration requirements were provided under section 8 of Act 750 to establish one’s eligibility to be registered by the Authority for a national ID card: * Voter identity card,... * Driver’s license, * Passport or * a baptismal certificateUpon assumption of office in the year 2017, President Akufo-Addo immediately set in motion his rigging agenda by causing this law, (Act 750) to be amended by the passage of the National Identity Register (Amendment Act), 2017 (Act 950).This new law (950) excluded the Voters’ ID card and the Driver’s License from the list of registration requirements without any legal or legitimate basis.The exclusion of the Voters’ ID card from requirements of registration for the national ID card by the Akufo-Addo govt was part of a well calculated scheme to disenfranchise a good number of Ghanaians from acquiring the national ID card (Ghana card), which was to be used ...... subsequently, as one of the registration requirements in the new voters’ register plan they had long hatched.The exclusion of the voters’ ID card from the registration requirements for the Ghana card was completely untenable as it contradicts every known best practice in Identity Management.All across the world, experts in the field of Identity Management agree that an identity document for a national database must be possessed by a significant number of the population, prevent duplication, and has enough information for easy verification of identity.Per this international standard, the Ghanaian Voters’ Identity Card ranks exceptionally high amongst all the identity cards that have been provided under Act 950. In spite of this fact, President Akufo-Addo Addo and ruling NPP have persistently bastardized the Voters’ ID card,... excluded same and rather promoted a total reliance on Birth Certificate and Passport (which requires the birth certificate to obtain), as the main registration requirements for the Ghana card, despite the relatively low integrity and credibility of these identity documents.This point is buttressed by “Paper Citizen” documentary of Joy FM which exposed how Birth Certificates are cheaply and illegally procured by citizens and foreigners with the aid of some corrupt officials at National Headquarters and Regional Offices of Birth and Death RegistryOur position on this matter all along has been that the NIA’s total reliance on the Birth Certificate and Passport as the main registration requirements for the Ghana card is problematic and will lead to a situation where about 76% of Ghanaians will have no ID documents to ...... establish their eligibility. These persons would have to go through a cumbersome process of obtaining a sworn oath before they can be registered for the Ghana card; a process we have maintained will slow down the registration process and disenfranchise a lot of Ghanaians.Right from the outset of the Ghana card registration exercise, we cautioned the NIA that their choice of breeder documents (Birth Certificate and Passport), coupled with their own methods for the instant issuance of cards will lead to a snail's pace registration process.However, Attafuah-led NIA rejected this good counsel and decided to take a gamble, in the hope that the sworn oath option, which per best practices, is supposed to be employed to register a very small percentage (usually 5%) of the population who do not have any form of ...... identification, could cure the problem we had foreseen.As we predicted, the Ghana card registration process by the NIA has been very slow such that till date, the process which commenced with a pilot late 2017 and was supposed to be completed in one year, has been able to register only 11,062,055 out of about 19 million Ghanaians ..... (15 years and above) who are eligible to be registered. Even more bizarre is the fact that, out of this 11 million Ghanaians who have been registered, only 7,074,048 have been issued with cards (per NIA’s own website https:http://nia.gov.gh ) as at 2nd May, 2020).In spite of several assurances made in Parliament and in the media by the President, the Heads of NIA and Electoral Commission that Ghana Card is not going to be used for the 2020 elections, the Government and the Commission are currently pushing a legislation in Parliament ...... to make the Ghana Card and Ghanaian Passport the main breeder documents for registration as a voter, thus excluding the use of the Commissions' own existing voters’ ID card.The objective is to disenfranchise a significant number of persons in NDC strongholds in furtherance of the Jean Mensah-led EC’s grand scheme to rig the 2020 general elections for the New Patriotic Party.According to the NIA’s own data, out of an estimated population of 17.3 million being 18 years and above, only 6.5 million have been issued with the Ghana Card. The implication is that, almost 11 million (constituting 62%) of eligible voters will have to go through the sworn ...... oath option to be able to register for a Voters’ ID, if the EC’s illogical and wasteful decision to compile a needless new Voter’s Register for the 2020 general elections materializes.Ladies and Gentlemen, even more disturbing is the breakdown of percentage per region of those who have to go through sworn oath to register as voters as depicted by the table below:pic.twitter.com/W2RFbe86HZLadies and Gentlemen, it is worth pointing out following notable regions: 1. The Upper West Region, out of the estimated registrable population of 472,391 only 24,427 representing 5.17% have been issued with the NIA cards. This means 94.83% must go through the Sworn Oath option2. Out of 708,584 estimated registrable population for the Upper East Region, 45,076 representing 6.36% have been issued with the NIA cards. Hence, 93.64% must go through the Sworn Oath option.3. Coming down to Ahafo Region through to the Central Region, the situation is no different. In Ahafo for instance, out of 349,474 registrable population, only 27,166 representing 7.77% have been issued with NIA cards leaving as many as 92.23% that must go thro’ Sworn Oath optionConsidering the time limitation imposed on the nation by Covid-19, this is not only impracticable but simply defies common sense and will surely disenfranchise a lot of eligible voters if the EC is allowed to proceed on this dangerous path.In sharp contrast to the suppression of Ghana card registration in mostly regions which are known to be NDC strongholds, the Ken Attafuah-led NIA massively mobilized unprecedented number of registration equipment for the exercise in stronghold of ruling NPP, the Ashanti RegionPrior to the Ghana card registration in the Ashanti Region, an average of 2,000 registration equipment per region were deployed. However, when it got the turn of the Ashanti region, the NIA miraculously increased the number of equipment for the exercise to 5,692.Prior to the Ghana card registration in the Ashanti Region, an average of 2,000 registration equipment per region were deployed. However, when it got the turn of the Ashanti region, the NIA miraculously increased the number of equipment for the exercise to 5,692.Also, the NIA provided additional 810 card printers to improve throughput and delivery and added 3,192 workstations to the pool during the Ashanti region registration exercise.This is same reason why President Akufo-Addo encouraged NIA to continue Ghana card registration in Eastern Region, another NPP stronghold even as he was restricting movement and gatherings, including church and mosque prayer services in the wake positive cases of the COVID19It does appear that the President who at age 74 is in the twilight of his long stint in politics, is not concerned about the future of Ghana, its peace, stability and the survival of democracy.Prior to becoming President, Akufo-Addo had presented himself as the paragon of excellence where democracy and rule of law are concerned. However, since becoming President, all his actions have unfortunately proven that was all talk, not substance.Having failed to deliver on his promises to the people of this country, and seeing defeat staring glaringly at him, he in conjunction with the Jean Mensah-led EC and the Ken Attafuah-led NIA are desperately scheming to rig the 2020 elections and hold on to power at all cost.Not even the unusual circumstances we find ourselves in, which require that we pull together for our collective survival as a nation, are enough to deter the actors of this plot from their ungodly act.While our country craves for vital investments and resources to overcome the COVID-19 scourge, President Akufo-Addo, aided by his ever pliable collaborators is bent on wasting huge sums of the taxpayers money to invite trouble for this country.Election rigging is not a one day event. It takes place over time through the systematic manipulation of processes leading to Election Day. We have long raised red flags and alerted civil society, religious leaders, traditional rulers, the media and all peace-loving Ghanaians ..... of the sinister rigging agenda of the Jean Mensah-led EC and the dangers it portends for our beloved country.Indeed many are those who have responded to the situation by even publicly questioning the rationale for a new voters’ register when nation has an existing voters’ register which has delivered 2 credible general elections and 3 District Level Elections with legitimate outcomesIt is to reassure the electorate of free and fair elections devoid of manipulation that the EC created IPAC whose inputs have over the years helped to guarantee a level playing field for all the political parties.Unfortunately, the Jean Mensah-led EC decided from the word go not to accord IPAC the same level of cooperation and respect as had been the case since 1994.The conspiracy to use the Ghana card is reason why at each and every turn, Jean Mensah seems impervious of the implications of her conduct and decisions. Her only mission and motivation, it appears, is to please President Akufo Addo and ensure his re-election for a second term.The rigging of the procurement processes that led to the selection of Thales, a company of questionable background as the suppliers of BVRs for the EC, the decision to exclude the existing Voters’ ID card and rather include the Ghana card whose issuance has been fraught with ...... serious anomalies, as a registration requirement for the illogical and needless new voters’ register the EC is seeking to foist on the nation, are all part of the grand rigging conspiracy of President Akufo-Addo, the Jean Mensah-led EC and the Ken Attafuah-led NIA.But the NDC shall employ every legitimate means to stop this evil conspiracy to rig the 2020 elections and subvert the democracy of this country.
