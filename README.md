# Azubi-Hackathon
Azubi Hackathon is a project in which we provide **Sentiment Analysis** on the 2020 Ghana Presidential Election using data obtained from twitter feeds.
This Repo was created by [Michael Sekyere](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-sekyere-0a4898193/ "Michael Sekyere"),
[Razack Abubakar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/razack-abubakar-853160156/ "Razack Abubakar") and
[Ama Owusu-Darko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aowusuda/ "Ama Owusu-Darko") as our capstone project as part of our training in Data Science in
the Azubi Africa Graduate Programme

## Introduction
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: This is a discipline of artificial intelligence, linguistics and computer science that is concerned with the creation of computational models that process and understand natural languages.The ultimate objective of NLP is to make the computer read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable. Most NLP techniques rely on machine learning to derive meaning from human languages.

* **Sentiment Analysis**: It is the interpretation and classification of emotions(positive, negative or neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis is helpful in allowing organizations to identify the public reaction to product, a message or an ideology, etc. For a political party, they can use sentiment analysis to to identify their campaign strategy and manifesto altogether

## Data
Data for the Analysis were gathered from twitter. Initially we created a Twitter Developer account, but there are limitations to it. You can not mine tweets older than 7 days, using twitter's rest API, unless you pay and even when you do, you are restricted to a limit of 100 tweets daily. Through research we came accross [Optimized-modified-GetOldTweets3-OMGOT](https://github.com/marquisvictor/Optimized-Modified-GetOldTweets3-OMGOT "Optimized-modified-GetOldTweets3-OMGOT") which is an improvement  of the original GetOldTweets Library by [Jefferson-Henrique](https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-python/ "Jefferson-Henrique"). With this we were able to bypass the limitations of using tweepy. Downloaded data and brief descriptions of them can be found on this [link](https://github.com/mickysekyere/Azubi-Hackathon/blob/master/Data/Data.md "link").
